## Google OAuth2 Integration

Securely authenticate users with Google OAuth2:

- **Implementation of Google OAuth2**: Integrate Google authentication using OAuth2 to enable users to log in to your Storybooks platform using their Google accounts.

- **Route for Initiating Authentication** (`/auth/google`): This route is responsible for initiating the Google OAuth2 authentication process. When users click on the "Login with Google" button, they are directed to this route to begin the authentication flow.

- **Callback Route for Handling OAuth2 Response** (`/auth/google/callback`): After users grant permission to your application, Google redirects them back to this route with an authorization code. This route handles the callback from Google and exchanges the code for an access token.

- **Passport.js Middleware**: Utilize the power of Passport.js middleware to handle authentication and session management seamlessly. Passport's `passport-google-oauth20` strategy is employed to streamline the Google OAuth2 authentication process.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Google Developer Project**:
   - Access the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Set up a new project and activate the Google+ API.
   - Generate OAuth2 credentials (client ID and client secret) to allow secure communication between your application and Google services.

2. **Configure Credentials**:
   - Safely store your Google OAuth2 credentials in the `config/config.env` file of your project. These credentials will be used to identify and authenticate your application with Google services.

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Install the necessary packages for Google OAuth2 integration using the command: `npm install passport passport-google-oauth20 express-session`.

4. **Passport.js Setup**:
   - In your main application file (e.g., `app.js`), initialize Passport.js using `passport.initialize()` and `passport.session()` middleware functions.

5. **Configure Google Strategy**:
   - Configure the Google OAuth2 strategy using `passport-google-oauth20`. Set the client ID, client secret, and callback URL.

6. **Route and Controller Implementation**:
   - Create routes within your `routes/auth.js` file to handle Google authentication. Implement corresponding controller functions to initiate the authentication process and manage the callback.

7. **Update Views**:
   - Enhance your relevant views (e.g., login page) by adding a "Login with Google" button that directs users to the `/auth/google` route to start the authentication flow.

By integrating Google OAuth2 into your Storybooks project, you provide users with a convenient and secure method of logging in, further enhancing their experience on the platform.
